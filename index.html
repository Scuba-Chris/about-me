                <p id="bio">I spent about 3 years going to <em>Green River Commuinity College.</em> 
                I studies many subject over the first 2 years. The majority of my time was spent learning 
                <em>engineering</em>. After, leaving school I spent about another three years in the 
                <em>construction field</em>. One of my main <em>goals</em> with getting into coding is to work
                for <em>Microsoft or a start-up</em>.
